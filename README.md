# MachineLearning

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project I had to complete the Q-learning algorithm for this machine learning algorithm. I was given code that created the maze let the agent move through the maze and code that remembered previous iterations threw the maze to use to choose the correct path.
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Machine learning is the cutting edge of how computers can be utilized. It is able to answer tough problems by using computers' ability to process lots of data continuously.
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create programs to allow others to use the power of computers to accomplish tasks much faster or better than they would otherwise be able to.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by trying to figure out how a computer could comprehend and solve it. I do this by trying to break the problem down to its most basic inputs and outputs.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I have a responsibility to hold any use and companies data in privacy and work to create the best solution possible for any problems. Communicating how computers will effectively use data and solve problems is also very important in my ethical responsibilities.
